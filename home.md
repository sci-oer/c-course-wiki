#### Coding Conventions used in this resource

Everyone has their favourite conventions for computer programs. This resource follows the conventions that I require of C programming students.  Examples are written to compile with `gcc`, using `-ansi -Wall` flags. All of the examples will also compile with `-std=c99
-Wall`.

All examples are written with clarity for the reader as the primary objective. Variables are declared first and initialized in a separate step. Shorthand notation for operations is never used. Everything is parenthesized, even when it might not have to be.
