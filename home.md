#### About this Resource

Everyone has their favourite conventions for computer programs. This resource is written with the assumption that you are following (or at least aware of) the conventions that I impose on my programming students.

All examples are written with clarity for the reader as the primary objective. This means that variables are declared first and initialized in a separate step. It means that shorthand notation for operations is never used. It means that everything is parenthesized, even when it might not have to be. Examples are written to compile with `gcc`, using `-ansi -Wall` flags. All of the examples will also compile with `-std=c99
-Wall`.
