#### About this Resource

This resource provides an electronic textbook in the form of a wiki, combined with interactive tutorials and pre-recorded lectures.   Links to the tutorials and lectures are provided in the appropriate wiki page, however you may also jump directly to one of the other resources.
- [Pre recorded lectures](http://localhost:8000/lectures/)
- [Interactive Tutorials](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/tutorials)
- [Ansi C documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs/)

Everyone has their favourite conventions for computer programs. This resource follows the conventions that I require of C programming students.  Examples are written to compile with `gcc`, using `-ansi -Wall` flags. All of the examples will also compile with `-std=c99
-Wall`.

All examples are written with clarity for the reader as the primary objective. Variables are declared first and initialized in a separate step. Shorthand notation for operations is never used. Everything is parenthesized, even when it might not have to be.
