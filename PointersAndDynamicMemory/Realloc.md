## Realloc {#realloc .unnumbered}

It is possible to increase or decrease the size of allocated memory
using realloc. The format of the function call is
**realloc(pointerToExistingMemory, NewSizeInBytes);**

Its important to note that the new size is the total size desired, not
just the additional size.

    char * ptr;
    char * largerPtr;
    ptr = malloc(sizeof(char) * 10);
    strcpy (ptr, "dinosaurs"); /*the string is now full- lets say we wanted to add  " are extinct" */
    largerPtr = realloc(ptr, sizeof(char) *22);  /* now there is room for the rest of the words*/
    strcpy largerPtr ("dinosaurs are extinct");

You can also just reuse the original pointer so that your code looks
like this:

    ptr = realloc(ptr, sizeof(char) *22); 

In this case the original value of ptr is overwritten with the new value
from realloc. This is almost always the desired outcome.

Realloc returns NULL if there is an error condition. How would that
affect the previous snippet of code?

Realloc does one of three things

-   if there is enough space to simply expand the current block of
    memory, the additional memory is allocated and realloc returns the
    original value of myPtr;

-   if there is enough memory, but not in the current location, a new
    block of memory is allocated elsewhere, the data is copied from the
    old block to the new block, the old block of memory is freed and the
    address of the new block of memory is returned.

-   if there is not enough memory, realloc returns a null pointer, but
    does not free the memory from the original block. (you can
    accidentally overwrite a pointer this way)

If you send a NULL to realloc as the first argument, it acts like malloc
`otherPtr = realloc(NULL, sizeof(char) * 100);`.

If you send a 0 to realloc as the second parameter, the memory is freed
and NULL is returned `otherPtr = realloc(otherPtr,0);` Generally it is
better practice to use the function for its purpose and not overload it
to do something that other functions are meant to do.

## Freeing Memory {#freeing-memory .unnumbered}

Â Whenever you allocate memory from the heap, you must also free it. Even
if you allocate memory from within a function, it must be freed
somewhere. This is only true for heap memory (stuff you allocate with
malloc).

You must free memory in the reverse order that you allocate it for
arrays of more than one dimension. For example for a 2D array you should
do the following:

-   start with the actual elements of the array and free those

-   then free the pointer to the array
